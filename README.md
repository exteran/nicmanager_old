# NICMananger

## Introduction
<img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/exteran/nicmanager/main/img/nicmanager_queryform.jpg" alt="NICManager">This software is designed to digitize law enforcement records on local systems and servers for ease of access by personnel needing access to NCIC NIC file entries for records look-up, file maintenance, and hit confirmation request and response purposes. Many agencies still use hard copies (paper filing) for its NIC entry files, and personnel must search--by hand--the archive in order to find the relevant records. Digitizing these records can speed up the process of locating valid files quickly and easily.
